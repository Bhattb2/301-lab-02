Lab-02 jQuery Selectors and Events

### User Stories

## MVP
    1. As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.

    2. As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.

    3. As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a grid like pattern.

### Time Estimates

Feature 1: Display Images
    
    Estimate of time needed to complete: 1.5 hours

    Start time: 12:00 pm 

    Finish time: 2:30 pm

    Actual time needed to complete: 2 hours

    Struggled to get the images to render and live server to display the images.

Feature 2: Filter Images
    
    Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours

    Start time: 3:30 pm

    Finish time: 8.45 pm

    Actual time needed to complete: 5 hours

    Lon, tedious, drawn process. Lot of googling and trail and error.

Feature 3: Style the application
    
    Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

    Start time: 9:00 pm

    Finish time: 10:15 pm

    Actual time needed to complete: 1.25 hours
